comment: Taxon notes: Among Decapodiformes (ten-limbed cephalopods), generally either one or both of arms IV are hectocotylized; in incirrate octopuses it is one of arm pair III.[1] Many coleoids lack hectocotyli altogether.[1] The shape of the tip of the hectocotylus has been much used in octopod systematics. In many species it is considerably elaborated. However, in the males of some species, such as the Seven-arm Octopus (Haliphron atlanticus), the hectocotylus develops in an inconspicuous sac in front of the right eye that gives the male the appearance of having only seven arms

name: jet propulsion
def: "This is the typical method of fast swimming in cephalopods. During jet propulsion, water is taken into the mantle cavity by expansion of the mantle. Water enters laterally at the sides of the head, passes over the collar, over the gills and leaves through the funnel when the mantle contracts. Mantle contraction causes water pressure in the mantle cavity to increase and forces the collar against the mantle wall. The collar, therefore, acts as a one-way valve to prevents water from leaving by the same route that it entered. The ventral wall of the funnel presses against the mantle during mantle contraction and seals that opening as well. Water, therefore, is forced through the funnel and out the funnel orifice. The force provided by the water leaving the funnel can be directed by movements of the funnel. Typically the water leaves the funnel anteriorly causing the cephalopod to jet backward (e.g. when escaping a predator) or the funnel is directed posteriorly causing the water to leave posteriorly and the animal to jet anteriorly (e.g. when pouncing on a prey). Some species are able to glide via this method." [http://tolweb.org/accessory/Cephalopod_Jet_Propulsion?acc_id=2060, Wikipedia:Ommastrephidae]

def: "Ovum-producing female reproductive organ." [Wikipedia:Ovary]
comment: Ovaries of some kind are found in the female reproductive system of many animals that employ sexual reproduction, including invertebrates. However, they develop in a very different way in most invertebrates than they do in vertebrates, and are not truly homologous. Many of the features found in human ovaries are common to all vertebrates, including the presence of follicular cells, tunica albuginea, and so on. However, many species produce a far greater number of eggs during their lifetime than do humans, so that, in fish and amphibians, there may be hundreds, or even millions of fertile eggs present in the ovary at any given time. In these species, fresh eggs may be developing from the germinal epithelium throughout life. Corpora lutea are found only in mammals, and in some elasmobranch fish; in other species, the remnants of the follicle are quickly resorbed by the ovary. In birds, reptiles, and monotremes, the egg is relatively large, filling the follicle, and distorting the shape of the ovary at maturity. Amphibians and reptiles have no ovarian medulla; the central part of the ovary is a hollow, lymph-filled space. The ovary of teleosts is also often hollow, but in this case, the eggs are shed into the cavity, which opens into the oviduct. Although most normal female vertebrates have two ovaries, this is not the case in all species. In birds and platypuses, the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional. In some elasmobranchs, the reverse is true, with only the right ovary fully developing. In the primitive jawless fish, and some teleosts, there is only one ovary, formed by the fusion of the paired organs in the embryo[WP].

One pair in 6,7,8 and 9 segments. They receive and store the spermatozoa of another earthworm during copulation.[3] They are lined with epithelium  and are variable in shape; some are thin, heavily coiled tubes, others are vague outpocketings from the main reproductive tract. It is one of the many variations in sexual reproduction[WP]. an accordion-like tube that contains sperm and is the site of oocyte fertilization." [Wikipedia:Spermatheca]

In other organisms such as insects, salivary glands are often used to produce biologically important proteins like silk or glues, and fly salivary glands contain polytene chromosomes that have been useful in genetic research[WP]." [GO:0007431, Wikipedia:Salivary_gland]
comment: currently we define saliva and salivary glands very generally in functional terms but it may be more appropriate to split this class. From WP: In most vertebrates, saliva does not contain any enzymes, consisting of mucus and water only, and its primary function is to moisten food while eating. As a result, true salivary glands are rarely found in fish or aquatic tetrapods, although there are often individual mucus-secreting cells. Amphibians have a single salivary gland, the intermaxillary gland, located in the forward part of the palate. Reptiles and birds  normally have only very small glands on the lips, palate, and base of the mouth, although there are some birds with large glands, which produce a sticky saliva that helps in nest-building. The distinct parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands are only developed in mammals.[3] The salivary glands of some species, however, are modified to produce enzymes; salivary amylase is found in many, but by no means all, bird and mammal species (including humans, as noted above). Furthermore, the venom glands of poisonous snakes, Gila monsters, and some shrews, are modified salivary glands

comment: The cecum is present in mammals and squid,[1] and two ceca are present in most birds (and some reptiles). Most herbivores have a relatively large cecum , hosting a large number of bacteria, which aid in the enzymatic breakdown of plant materials such as cellulose. Exclusive carnivores, whose diets contain little or no plant material, have a reduced cecum; often partially or wholly replaced by the vermiform appendix. It is in the large intestine which is near the small intestine.

comment: GO says gut is region of DT, from intestines to anus. ZFA treats as synonym for alimentary canal, and treats it as the sum of DT + organs (ZF has no term from stomach). GO says intestines to anus (excludes stomach and esophagus). MA appears to agree with GO (stomach and esophagus are not parts). FMA includes stomach and esophagus as parts of gut -- the FMA divides gut into lower and upper GI tract; it's not clear if this is exhaustive (small intestine is in neither), but lower GI tract may correspond better to the GO definition.

name: skeletal tissue
comment: Four classes of mineralized tissues are found in vertebrates: bone, cartilage, dentine, and enamel. We think of cartilage and bone as skeletal tissues and of enamel and dentine as dental tissues, but enamel and dentine arose evolutionarily together with bone as skeletal tissues in the dermal skeleton (exoskeleton) of early vertebrates. Scales and teeth of sharks are examples of dermal skeletal elements that are still composed of the three ancient components-enamel, dentine, and bone. Cartilage, on the other hand, provided the basis for the second vertebrate skeletal system, the endoskeleton (Smith and Hall, 1990; Hall, 1998a,b). some invertebrate skeletal tissues have surprisingly bone-like features. Examples include chondrocytes interconnected by cell processes in cephalopod cartilages (Cole and Hall, 2004a,b), and the calcium phosphate layer in the shells of brachiopods (Rodland et al., 2003). However, neither bone nor mineralized cartilage have been found in invertebrates

name: olfactory system
def: "The olfactory system is the sensory system used for olfaction, or the sense of smell. Most mammals and reptiles have two distinct parts to their olfactory system: a main olfactory system and an accessory olfactory system. The main olfactory system detects volatile, airborne substances, while the accessory olfactory system senses fluid-phase stimuli. Behavioral evidence indicates that most often, the stimuli detected by the accessory olfactory system are pheromones. The olfactory system is often spoken of along with the gustatory system as the chemosensory senses because both transduce chemical signals into perception[WP]." [Wikipedia:Olfactory_system]
comment: In mammals, the main olfactory system detects odorants that are inhaled through the nose, where they contact the main olfactory epithelium, which contains various olfactory receptors. These olfactory receptors are membrane proteins of bipolar olfactory receptor neurons in the olfactory epithelium. Rather than binding specific ligands  like most receptors, olfactory receptors display affinity for a range of odor molecules. Olfactory neurons transduce receptor activation into electrical signals in neurons. The signals travel along the olfactory nerve, which belongs to the peripheral nervous system. This nerve terminates in the olfactory bulb, which belongs to the central nervous system. The complex set of olfactory receptors on different olfactory neurons can distinguish a new odor from the background environmental odors and determine the concentration of the odor.
