*This is a collection of Terminology, Entomological and Arthropodal in
general, some of which you will find used on the other pages of this
site, but I have included a lot more words than I have been able to use
in the pages of this site, I hope you find them useful.*

*It Does Not Contain Any Animal Names, Insect or otherwise, and is _Not_
a Checklist of any sort*

If you have a word you think should be here and isn't please let me know.

wing in many true flies (plural: squamae).
*Stadium.* (pl., stadia). The time interval between molts in a
developing insect.
*Stage.* A distinct, sharply differentiated period in the development of
an insect, e.g., egg stage, larval stage, pupal stage, adult stage; in
mites and ticks, each instar.
*Stemma.* (pl., stemmata). The simple eye in holometabolous larvae. Also
called lateral ocellus.
*Sternite.* The plate or sclerite on the underside of a body segment.
*Stigma.* A small coloured area near the wing-tip of dragonflies, bees,
and various other clear-winged insects: also called the pterostigma.
*Stomodeal valve.* In insects, the cylindrical or funnel-shaped
invagination of the foregut into the midgut.
*Striae.* Grooves running across or along the body: applied especially
to the grooves on beetle elytra.
*Striated muscle.* Muscle that is composed of fibers with alternate
light and dark bands.
*Stridulation.* The production of sounds by rubbing two parts of the
body together: best known in grasshoppers and other orthopterans.
*Style.* A slender bristle arising at the apex of the antenna.
*Style.* One of the small paired appendages on the male subgenital plate
of some Orthoptera.
*Stylet.* A needle-like object: applied to the various components of
piercing mouthparts and also to a part of the sting of a bee or other
hymenopteran.
*Stylostome.* The tube formed by the host as a result of the feeding of
a chigger; in secreting salivary fluids, the chigger partially digests
skin tissues, which induces the host to form a proteinaceous tube
walling off the injury.
*Sub-apical.* Situated just before the tip or apex.
*Subcosta.* Usually the first of the longitudinal veins behind the front
edge of the wing, although it is often missing or very faint:
abbreviated to Sc.
*Sub-imago.* Found only among the mayflies, the sub-imago or dun is the
winged insect which emerges from the nymphal skin. It is rather dull in
colour, but very soon moults again - the only example of a winged insect
undergoing a moult - to reveal the imago.
*Sub-marginal Cells.* Cells lying just behind the stigma in the
hymenopteran forewing: important in the identification of bees and
sphecid wasps.
*Sub-species.* A sub-division of a species, usually inhabiting a
particular area: visibly different from other populations of the same
species but still able to interbreed with them.
*Superfamily.* A group of closely related families; superfamily names
end in -oidea.
*Supplementary reproductives.* In termites the caste of males and
females with short wings, light pigmentation, and small compound eyes.
The females lay eggs in the colony supplementing the work of the queen.
*Suture.* A groove on the body surface which usually divides one plate
or sclerite from the next: also the junction between the elytra of a
beetle.
*Synonym.* One of two or more names which have been given to a single
species. The earliest name usually (should) takes precedence.
*Systemic insecticide.* An insecticide capable of absorption into plant
sap or animal blood and lethal to insects feeding on or within the
treated host.

T
*Tarsus.* (pl., tarsi). The insect's foot: primitively a single segment
but consisting of several segments in most living insects.
*Tegmen.* (plural tegmina) The leathery forewing of a grasshopper or
similar insect, such as a cockroach
*Tegula.* A small lobe or scale overlying the base of the forewing like
a shoulder-pad.
*Tergite.* The primary plate or sclerite forming the dorsal surface of
any body segment.
*Tergum.* The dorsal surface of any body segment.
*Thorax. *The middle of the three major divisions of the insect body.
The legs and wings (if present) are always attached to the thorax.
*Tibia.* (pl., tibiae) The forth leg segment between the femur and the
tarsus.
*Totipotency* The potential, throughout life, to express the full
behavioral repertoire of the population (even if never actually
expressed), and the ability to produce offspring like oneself,
exhibiting the full behavioral repertoire of the population, without help.
*Trachea.* (Plural tracheae). One of the minute tubes which permeate the
insect body and carry gases to and from the various organs etc. They
open to the air at the spiracles.
*Transverse Suture.* A suture running across the thorax of many flies
and dividing the mesonotum into a scutum and a prescutum.
*Triangle.* A triangular region near the base of the dragonfly wing,
often divided into smaller cells.
*Triungulin.* Name given to the active 1^st - instar larva of oil
beetles and some of their relatives: they appear to have 3 claws on each
foot.
*Trochanter.* The second segment of the leg, between coxa and femur:
often very small and easily overlooked.
*Truncate.* Ending abruptly: squared off.
*Tubercle.* A small knob like or rounded protuberance.
*Tymbal.* The sound-producing 'drum-skin' of a cicada.
*Tympanum.* The auditory membrane or ear-drum of various insects.
*Type.* The type specimen of a species is the actual insect from which
the original description of that species was produced. If several
specimens were used for this purpose, one of them should have been
designated as the type. Because the type can be of only one sex, it is
usual to designate a certain individual of the opposite sex as the
allotype. The original type specimen is then called the holotype. These
?type specimens' are very important in taxonomy and classification.

U
*Uric acid. * The chief nitrogenous waste of birds, reptiles and
insects-; chemically, C,H,N,O,.

V
*Valve.* One of the paired components of the ovipositor.
*Veins.* In insects, the rib like tubes that strengthen the wings.
*Vermiform larva.* A legless wormlike larva without a well developed head
*Venation.* The arrangement of veins in the wings of insects. Ventral.
Concerning the lower side of the body.
*Vertex.* The top of the head, between and behind the eyes.
*Vestigial.* Poorly developed, degenerate or atrophied, more fully
functional in an earlier stage of development of the individual or species.
*Visceral muscle.* A muscle which invests an internal organ.
*Vibrissae.* The pair of large bristles just above the mouth in certain
flies: usually simply called vibrissae.
*Viviparous.* Bringing forth living or active young instead of laying eggs

W
*Wing pads*. The undeveloped wings of nymphs and naiads, which appear as
two flat structures on each side.
*Woollybear.* A very hairy caterpillar belonging to the family
Arctiidae, the tiger moths.
*Workers.* In termites, the sterile males and females that perform most
of the work of the colony; they are pale, wingless, and usually lack
compound eyes; in social Hymenoptera, females with undeveloped
reproductive organs that perform the work of the colony.
