# On-boarding new Uberon curators

This document is intended as a quick checklist that *existing* curators
can follow to ensure that *new* curators are provided with the
informations and the access that they need in order to start working
with Uberon.

1. Invite them to the [Anatomy and Cell
   Ontologies](https://anatomy-and-cell-onto.slack.com) Slack workspace.
2. Invite them to the [OBO Community](https://obo-communitygroup.slack.com)
   Slack workspace and point them to the `#uberon` channel.
3. Add them to the meeting invites on the Monarch Calendar (FIXME: How
   to do that? Who is the person to contact?)
4. Add their names to the table in the [docs/team.md](team.md) page.
5. Invite them to the [Uberon/CL curators GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/obophenotype/teams/uberon-cl-curators).
6. Assign an ID range to each of them and add the ranges to the
   `src/ontology/uberon-idranges.owl` file.
7. Point them to the relevant documentation, especially
    * [Ontology Curator Pathway, GO-style](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/pathways/ontology-curator-go-style/),
    * [Contributing to OBO ontologies](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/lesson/contributing-to-obo-ontologies/),
    * [Standard Operating Procedures for Uberon Curators](uberon-editor-sop.md).
