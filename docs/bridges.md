# Uberon bridge files

Uberon provides _bridge files_ for several foreign ontologies,
especially species-specific anatomy ontologies (ssAOs). Each bridge file
contains _bridging axioms_ that establish a relationship between a
Uberon term and a term from the foreign ontology.

For example, the `uberon-bridge-to-zfa` bridge contains axioms such as
this one:

> ZFA:0001262 EquivalentTo: UBERON:0005564 and (BFO:0000050 some NCBITaxon:7954)

which states that ZFA’s [gonad
primordium](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ZFA_0001262) (ZFA:0001262) is
equivalent to a Uberon’s [gonad
primordium](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0005564)
(UBERON:0005564) that is [part
of](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050) a
[Danio](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBITaxon_7954) (NCBITaxon:7954).

Such a bridge may be used by anyone who wants to merge Uberon and ZFA to
obtain an integrated ontology in which the _Danio_-specific terms in ZFA
are properly linked to their taxon-neutral counterparts in Uberon.
Internally, Uberon itself is using those bridges to produce the
[combined multispecies ontologies](combined_multispecies.md) such as
`composite-metazoan`.

In addition to the bridging axioms proper, the bridges also contain an
additional annotation for each bridged term: a “OBO Foundry unique
label” (`IAO:0000589`). That label is automatically derived from the
standard `rdfs:label` of the term, to which a suffix indicating the
taxon is appended (for example in the case of `ZFA:0001262`, the unique
label is “gonad primordium (zebrafish)”). This is to ensure that, upon
merging Uberon with taxon-specific ontologies, all the terms in the
merged ontology will have a distinct label.

Note that the bridges between the [Cell
Ontology](https://obophenotype.github.io/cell-ontology/) (CL) and the
species-specific anatomy ontologies are _also_ provided by Uberon, rather by CL
directly. This is because the pipeline that produces those bridges (briefly
described below) is entirely hosted in the Uberon repository.

The latest bridge files can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/tree/master/src/ontology/bridge).

## Sources of truth

Each bridge has one source of truth which may be:

* cross-references in Uberon or CL;
* cross-references in the foreign ontology;
* an externally provided _mapping set_;
* an externally provided _custom bridge_.

### Cross-references in Uberon or CL

Cross-references are currently the source of truth for most bridges. For
such bridges, a Uberon or CL term will carry a `oboInOwl:hasDbXref`
annotation (aka a “OBO-style cross-reference”) whose value is the short
identifier of the foreign term that is, by virtue of this
cross-reference, being mapped to the Uberon or CL term.

For example, Uberon contains the following annotation assertion:

> AnnotationAssertion(oboInOwl:hasDbXref UBERON:0005564 "ZFA:0001262")

by which Uberon’s [gonad
primordium](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0005564) is mapped to
the [equivalent term in
ZFA](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ZFA_0001262).

The annotations are present directly in the `-edit` file and may be
edited by curators as they wish, using e.g. Protégé.

Note that for an annotation such as the one above to be used when
producing the bridge files, the prefix used in the annotation (in this
example `ZFA`) must be declared in an ontology-level annotation that
will indicate the signification of the mapping. In the case of ZFA, the
declaration is as follows:

> Annotation(oboInOwl:treat-xrefs-as-reverse-genus-differentia "ZFA part\_of NCBITaxon:7954")

and it indicates that any mapping between a Uberon term and a term from
ZFA should result, when producing the bridge files, in a axiom that
states that the ZFA term is equivalent to the intersection of the Uberon
term and the existential restriction `part_of some Danio`.

Curators should not normally have to worry about declaring the prefixes
of foreign ontologies that Uberon provides bridges for, unless they want
to create a completely new bridge (which presumably should not be needed
often). But for reference, here are the other possible declaration
annotations and the meaning they give to the mappings:

* `oboInOwl:treat-xrefs-as-equivalent "PFX"`: indicates that terms in
  the _PFX_ namespace are equivalent to the Uberon or CL terms they are
  mapped to;
* `oboInOwl:treat-xrefs-as-is_a "PFX"`: indicates that terms in the
  _PFX_ namespace are parents of the Uberon or CL terms they are mapped
  to;
* `oboInOwl:treat-xrefs-as-has-subclass "PFX"`: indicates that terms in
  the _PFX_ namespaces are subclasses of the Uberon or CL terms they are
  mapped to.

### Cross-references in the foreign ontology

Some foreign ontologies maintain their own mappings with Uberon and/or
CL, using the same cross-reference-based system as used in Uberon and CL
and described above. In such cases, when generating the bridges Uberon
obtains the cross-references from the foreign ontologies and then
derives the bridging axioms from them in the same way as is done for
cross-references maintained internally in Uberon and CL.

Uberon or CL editors wishing to amend the mappings with an ontology that
maintain its own mappings should contact the editors of that ontology
directly, as the mappings cannot be edited directly within Uberon or CL.
Adding a cross-reference in Uberon or CL is possible but will have no
effect on the bridges.

### Externally provided mapping sets

Some foreign ontologies maintain their own mappings with Uberon and/or
CL, and provide the mappings in the form of a
[SSSOM](https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/) mapping set. For
such ontologies, Uberon simply uses the mapping set as provided and
derives the bridging axioms from it. In that case, Uberon or CL editors
wishing to amend the mappings should contact the editors of the foreign
ontology, as the mappings cannot be edited directly within Uberon/CL.
Adding a cross-reference in Uberon or CL will have _no_ effect.

### Externally provided custom bridges

Some foreign sources provide “custom” or “complex” bridge files that
they generate on their side using whatever pipeline they need. Uberon
simply uses those bridge files as they are. As for the case of
externally provided mapping sets, Uberon or CL editors wishing to amend
those bridges should contact the upstream source.

## Producing the bridges

This section is a (very) brief overview of the pipeline that generates
the bridge files.

The pipeline may be triggered by invoking the Make target
`refresh-bridges` (whilst in the in `src/ontology` directory, where the
Makefile is located). Here is what happens then:

1. Production of a SSSOM mapping set from the Uberon cross-references.
   Cross-references are extracted directly from the Uberon `-edit` file
   and turned into a SSSOM mapping set. This takes care of all the
   mappings with the foreign ontologies for which Uberon is the source
   of truth.
2. Production of a SSSOM mapping sets from ontologies that maintain
   their own mappings as cross-references. The foreign ontologies are
   downloaded and their cross-references are extracted in the same way
   as the Uberon cross-references are. Note that currently there is no
   such ontology.
3. Fetching of externally maintained mapping sets. For ontologies that
   maintain their own mappings and provide a SSSOM mapping set directly,
   we fetch the mapping set as it is. This currently concerns FBbt and
   CL (the CL set brings with it the mappings between CL and all the
   species-specific ontologies).
4. Merging of all the mapping sets. We merge the SSSOM mapping set that
   was derived from the Uberon cross-references (step 1), the sets that
   were derived from the cross-references of foreign ontologies
   (step 2), and the sets that we obtained directly from foreign
   ontologies (step 3).
5. Production of the bridges. We apply a large SSSOM/T-OWL ruleset (in
   `tmp/bridges.rules`, derived from a M4 source in `bridges/rules.m4`)
   to produce bridging axioms from the mappings in the combined mapping
   set obtained at step 4.
6. Dispatching into individual bridges. The axioms produced at step 5
   are written to different bridges depending on the ontologies they are
   bridging (e.g., an axiom that bridges a Uberon term and a ZFA term
   will be written to the `uberon-bridge-to-zfa.owl` bridge file).
7. Fetching the custom bridges. Independently of all the previous steps,
   the “custom” bridges are fetched from their upstream source.

Note that steps 2, 3, and 7 only happen when the Make variable `IMP` is
set to `true` (which is always the case when the pipeline is explicitly
triggered with `make refresh-bridges`). When `IMP` is set to `false`,
the bridge files are re-generated using only locally available resources
previously committed to the repository.

Uberon maintainers should run `make refresh-bridges` periodically to
refresh external resources and commit refreshed versions to the
repository, similarly to what is needed to refresh the imports.
