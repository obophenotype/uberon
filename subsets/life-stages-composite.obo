comment: Following internal fertilization, early embryogenesis clearly proceeds within the oviduct in lizards genus Anolis, and most eggs are laid at the Early limb-bud stage of development (Stage 4). Juvenile lizards genus Anolis hatch with a snout-to-vent length of about 1.6 cm, after 22-27 days of incubation(see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17724661).

comment: Green anoles have a lifespan ranging from 2 to 8 years, determined largely by predation. Lifespan in captivity is similar to that in the wild, approximately 4 to 6 years (see http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Anolis_carolinensis/). We arbitraly consider 2 years as the upper limit for the adult stage, before aged stage. This is to improve as far as information is available.

comment: Bovine gestation is 277 days (about 9 months) (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Bos_taurus). Depending on the breed, the gestation time slightly varies (see http://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php?title=Bovine_Development). Gestational length is commonly calculated based on recorded insemination (see PMID:30452469), so actually this is the fetal age.

comment: Temporal ordering number - 570. DISAMBIGUATION: In Drosophila lab vernacular, the term 'pupal stage' is often used to refer to the entire period from formation of the puparium to eclosion. However, this does not correspond to the standard usage of 'pupal stage' for Cyclorrhaphous flies (for discussion see: FBrf0087128). Briefly: formation of the puparium (hardening of the larval cuticle) marks the beginning of the pre-pupal stage. The pupal stage begins following pupal/larval apolysis - detachment of the larval epidermis from the puparium. In Drosophila, the outward sign of the completion of apolysis is the eversion of the head and expulsion of the larval mouthparts (FBrf0036849). We use P-stage to refer to the stage from pupariation to eclosion, and restrict pupal stage to its standard usage.

def: "The stage of the Drosophila life-cycle from the formation of the puparium (beginning of the prepupal stage) to eclosion." [FBC:DOS]
comment: Temporal ordering number - 490. DISAMBIGUATION: In Drosophila lab vernacular, the term 'pupal stage' is often used to refer to the entire period from formation of the puparium to eclosion. However, this does not correspond to the standard usage of 'pupal stage' for cyclorrhaphous flies (for discussion see: FBrf0087128). Briefly: formation of the puparium (hardening of the larval cuticle) marks the beginning of the pre-pupal stage. The pupal stage begins following pupal/larval apolysis - detachment of the larval epidermis from the puparium. In Drosophila, the outward sign of the completion of apolysis is the eversion of the head an expulsion of the larval mouthparts (FBrf0036849). We use P-stage to refer to the stage from pupariation to eclosion, and restrict pupal stage to its standard usage.

comment: Prenatal development is a continuum, with no clear defining feature distinguishing an embryo from a fetus. The use of the term "fetus" generally implies that a mammalian embryo has developed to the point of being recognizable as belonging to its own species, though the point at which this occurs is subjective.

comment: HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) considers HP:0003581 (adult onset) as 'at the age of 16 years or later', but this adult stage directly follows the pediatric onset (HP:0410280) defined 'as before the age of 15 years' (see https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology/issues/6099). To be consistent, we consider adult stage as starting at 15 years.

comment: The definition of an age for human weaning is difficult to define due to individual and cultural variations. The natural age of weaning in humans could be 2.5 years, with maximum 7.0 years (see https://www.health-e-learning.com/articles/A_Natural_Age_of_Weaning.pdf), but we decide to stop this period at 1 year-old, before usually language acquisition.

comment: The life span of opossums is very short. The average female probably lives through one breeding season (see http://www.mspca.org/programs/wildlife-resources/species-information/about-opossums.html). In the wild, two years is the standard lifespan (http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Monodelphis_domestica/). We decided to consider 21 months as the upper limit for breeding age, before aged stage.

comment: This stage actually starts at about 3.5 years, the age of sexual maturity. See 3-year-old immature stage and 3-year-old mature stage. The females of this species reach menopause at about the age of 25 (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Macaca_mulatta). We decided to consider this age as the upper limit for adulthood stage, before geriatric age.

They can live up to 12 years in the wild (see http://www.mspca.org/programs/wildlife-resources/species-information/about-platypuss.html) and one captive specimen was at least 22.6 years old when it died (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Ornithorhynchus_anatinus). Over 10 years old is usually no more a breeding age.

def: "Pig developmental stage that covers the period from birth until about 2 months old, at which point individuals wean." [Bgee:curator]
comment: Age of weaning is 56 days (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Sus_scrofa). Piglets are highly precocious and neonates appear with open eyes, good muscle tone and well developed skin and hair (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23874755). Within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, they will attempt to suckle. The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the anterior teats produce a greater quantity of milk (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piglet_%28animal%29).

comment: Pig reach sexual maturity by 768 days of age for male, 334 days for female. While achieving sexual maturity much earlier, males do not typically mate until they are about 5 years old (see http://genomics.senescence.info/species/entry.php?species=Sus_scrofa).

comment: We define pig early and late embryonic stages based on fetal growth (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15446468). Pig embryo begins to attach to the uterus on days 13–14 of pregnancy (see https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Pig_Development#Normal_Stages). At that stage, this is a 6-somite pig embryo (see https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Book_-_Embryology_of_the_Pig_5).

It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string

For example, turtles have only eight pairs of ribs, which are developed into a bony or cartilagenous carapace and plastron, while snakes have numerous ribs running along the full length of their trunk. Frogs typically have no ribs, aside from a sacral pair, which form part of the pelvis. Mammals usually also only have distinct ribs on the thoracic vertebra, although fixed cervical ribs are also present in monotremes. In marsupials and placental mammals, the cervical and lumbar ribs are found only as tiny remnants fused to the vertebrae, where they are referred to as transverse processes. In general, the structure and number of the true ribs in humans is similar to that in other mammals. Unlike reptiles, caudal ribs are never found in mammals." xsd:string
