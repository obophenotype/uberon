The salivary glands extend to the second abdominal segment, with cells larger in the posterior than in the anterior of the gland. Mouth hooks typically have 9-12 teeth. About 24 hours before pupariation (at 25 degree C), larvae stop feeding and climb away from their food. Duration at 25 degrees C: approximately 48 hours (72-120 hours after egg laying; 48-96 hours after hatching)." [FlyBase:FBrf0007733]

comment: Temporal ordering number - 490. DISAMBIGUATION: In Drosophila lab vernacular, the term 'pupal stage' is often used to refer to the entire period from formation of the puparium to eclosion. However, this does not correspond to the standard usage of 'pupal stage' for cyclorrhaphous flies (for discussion see: FBrf0087128). Briefly: formation of the puparium (hardening of the larval cuticle) marks the beginning of the pre-pupal stage. The pupal stage begins following pupal/larval apolysis - detachment of the larval epidermis from the puparium. In Drosophila, the outward sign of the completion of apolysis is the eversion of the head an expulsion of the larval mouthparts (FBrf0036849). We use P-stage to refer to the stage from pupariation to eclosion, and restrict pupal stage to its standard usage.

comment: comment: stage description from G.Gillard (https://github.com/garethgillard), months 3-6, 5-8 cm. Approximately 4- 5 weeks after hatching the young fish makes its way through the gravel and begins active feeding. At this point they are approximately 3 inches long and are called "fry" or fingerlings. One year after hatching the fry change coloring and acquire distinctive markings on their flanks which now distinguishes them as "parr" (http://www.uky.edu/~agrdanny/flyfish/life.htm).

comment: dedicated to PMID:32293070; developmentally it makes sense to consider fry before feeding as a category. At least, when the yolk sac is depleted they are considered as at the fry stage. They fed then after that in experiments. They could feed before in the wild of course, so not completely tied to developmental stage, but a common point of difference the feeding (source: discussion with G.Gillard, https://github.com/garethgillard).

comment: We define pig early and late embryonic stages based on fetal growth (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15446468). Pig embryo begins to attach to the uterus on days 13–14 of pregnancy (see https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Pig_Development#Normal_Stages). At that stage, this is a 6-somite pig embryo (see https://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/embryology/index.php/Book_-_Embryology_of_the_Pig_5).

property_value: editor_note "An example is: translation preceded_by transcription; aging preceded_by development (not however death preceded_by aging). Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string
