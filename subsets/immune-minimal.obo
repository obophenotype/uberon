comment: Markers are associated with mice. The Gr epitope is used to describe this cell type is found on both Ly6c and Ly6g. However, its the Ly6c that is considered the specific marker, and thus used in the cross-product.

comment: Normally represent 10-20% of peripheral blood mDCs (human). They are also CD281-positive (TLR1), CD282-positive (TLR2), CD283-positive (TLR3), CD284-positive (TLR4), CD285-positive (TLR5), CD286-positive (TLR6), CD288-positive (TLR8), and CD290-positive (TLR10) [PMID:20204387]. Upon TLR stimulation, these cells were potent producers of CXCL8 (IL-8), while producing little TNF-alpha.

Erythrocytes pass through the cords of Billroth before entering the sinusoids. The passage into the sinusoids may be seen as a bottleneck, where erythrocytes need to be flexible in order to pass through. In disorders of erythrocyte shape and/or flexibility, such as hereditary spherocytosis, erythrocytes fail to pass through and get phagocytosed, causing extravascular hemolysis."

That fact facilitates spreading of tumors cells through these lymphatics in cases of cancers of the stomach and particularly of the esophagus.

def: "A lymphoid organ found in various mammals and some birds." [Wikipedia:Haemal_nodes]
comment: Hemal nodes are characterized by the presence of large numbers of erythrocytes. Lymph nodes (see below) and hemal nodes share some similarities of structure, but really are fundamentally different organs both qualitatively and quantitatively. Both lymph and hemal nodes contain diffuse lymphatic tissue, and in most cases have nodular tissue in the form of germinal centers, as well. Like the lymph node, the hemal node has a cortex and a medulla, and germinal centers are frequently seen. There's a distinct capsule, and hemal nodes are served at the hilus by an afferent arteriole.
