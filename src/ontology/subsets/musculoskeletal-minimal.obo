These scales develop from the dermal layer of the skin, which is in contrast to the epidermal development seen the in the elasmoid scales of tetrapods. The shape of denticle varies from species to species and can be used in identification. Studies have found that the denticles create tiny vortices that reduce drag to make swimming more efficient.

property_value: UBPROP:0000008 "In primitive tetrapods, such as Trematops, the tarsus consists of three rows of bones. There are three proximal tarsals, the tibiale, intermedium, and fibulare, named for their points of articulation with the bones of the lower limb. These are followed by a second row of four bones, referred to as the centralia (singular: centrale), and then a row of five distal tarsals, each articulating with a single metatarsal. In the great majority of tetrapods, including all of those alive today, this simple pattern is modified by the loss and fusion of various of the bones.[3] In reptiles and mammals, there are normally just two proximal tarsals, the calcaneus (equivalent to the amphibian fibulare) and the talus (probably derived from a fusion of multiple bones). In mammals, including humans, the talus forms a hinge joint with the tibia, a feature especially well developed in the artiodactyls. The calcaneus is also modified, forming a heel for the attachment of the Achilles tendon. Neither of these adaptations is found in reptiles, which have a relatively simple structure to both bones.[3] The fifth distal tarsal disappears relatively early in evolution, with the remainder becoming the cuneiform and cuboid bones. Reptiles usually retain two centralia, while mammals typically have only one (the navicular).[3] In birds, the tarsus has disappeared, with the proximal tarsals having fused with the tibia, the centralia having disappeared, and the distal bones having fused with the metatarsals to form a single tarsometatarsus bone, effectively giving the leg a third segment" xsd:string {source="Wikipedia:Tarsus_(skeleton)"}

From its origin each muscle runs a short way down until it divides into two tendons that continue down and insert onto the base of its corresponding proximal phalanx. Each tendon has a sesamoid imbedded within it, that lie over the metacarpophalangeal joint. A small tendon, sometimes known as an extensor branch, continues to proceed from the base of each proximal phalanx and connects to the common extensor tendon. It has a small role to play in the extension of each phalanx. The main innervation of this muscle is via a branch of the ulnaris nerve[MURDOCH:1022]." xsd:string {source="MURDOCH:1022"}

def: "A circumorbital muscle in the face that closes the eyelid[HP]." [Wikipedia:Orbicularis_oculi_muscle]
comment: It arises from the nasal part of the frontal bone, from the frontal process of the maxilla in front of the lacrimal groove, and from the anterior surface and borders of a short fibrous band, the medial palpebral ligament. From this origin, the fibers are directed lateralward, forming a broad and thin layer, which occupies the eyelids or palpebræ, surrounds the circumference of the orbit, and spreads over the temple, and downward on the cheek. The palpebral portion of the muscle is thin and pale; it arises from the bifurcation of the medial palpebral ligament, forms a series of concentric curves, and is inserted into the lateral palpebral raphé. The orbital portion is thicker and of a reddish color; its fibers form a complete ellipse without interruption at the lateral palpebral commissure; the upper fibers of this portion blend with the Frontalis and Corrugator. The lacrimal part (Tensor tarsi) is a small, thin muscle, about 6 mm. in breadth and 12 mm. in length, situated behind the medial palpebral ligament and lacrimal sac. It arises from the posterior crest and adjacent part of the orbital surface of the lacrimal bone, and passing behind the lacrimal sac, divides into two slips, upper and lower, which are inserted into the superior and inferior tarsi medial to the puncta lacrimalia; occasionally it is very indistinct.

Later in development, the bone structure breaks loose from the jaw and migrates to the inner ear area. The structure is known as the middle ear, and is made up of the incus, stapes, malleus, and tympanic membrane.

def: "A system of fluid passages in the inner ear, including both the cochlea, which is part of the auditory system, and the vestibular system, which provides the sense of balance. The bony labyrinth, or osseous labyrinth, is the network of passages with bony walls lined with periosteum. The bony labyrinth is lined with the membranous labyrinth. There is a layer of perilymph between them. The three parts of the bony labyrinth are the vestibule of the ear, the semicircular canals, and the cochlea. The vestibular system is the region of the inner ear where the semicircular canals converge, close to the cochlea (the hearing organ). The vestibular system works with the visual system to keep objects in focus when the head is moving. Joint and muscle receptors also are important in maintaining balance. The brain receives, interprets, and processes the information from these systems that control our balance. [WP,unvetted]." [Wikipedia:Bony_labyrinth]
comment: Ideally we would place a spatially disjoint from relationship to membranous labyrinth, but there are many parts in common. this should be resolved.

name: notochord
namespace: uberon
def: "A flexible rod-shaped body found in embryos of all chordates. It is composed of cells derived from the mesoderm and defines the primitive axis of the embryo. In some chordates, it persists throughout life as the main axial support of the body, while in most vertebrates it becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc. The notochord is found ventral to the neural tube." [http://tolweb.org/Chordata/2499, https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/25, https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/271, ISBN:0815318960, Wikipedia:Notochord]
comment: The notochord appears early in embryogeny and plays an important role in promoting or organizing the embryonic development of nearby structures. In most adult chordates the notochord disappears or becomes highly modified. In some non-vertebrate chordates and fishes the notochord persists as a laterally flexible but incompressible skeletal rod that prevents telescopic collapse of the body during swimming[TOLWEB]

comment: WP:Heart states: "The SA node is found in all amniotes but not in more primitive vertebrates. In these animals, the muscles of the heart are relatively continuous and the sinus venosus coordinates the beat which passes in a wave through the remaining chambers. Indeed, since the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right atrium in amniotes, it is likely homologous with the SA node. In teleosts, with their vestigial sinus venosus, the main centre of coordination is, instead, in the atrium.". Note however that ZFA has SA node.

The few exceptions include the manatee and the sloths, of which the two-toed sloth has six cervical vertebrae and the three-toed sloth has up to nine cervical vertebrae. In many species, though not in mammals, the cervical vertebrae bear ribs. In many other groups, such as lizards and saurischian dinosaurs, the cervical ribs are large; in birds they are small and completely fused to the vertebrae. The transverse processes of mammals are homologous to the cervical ribs of other amniotes. Thoracic vertebrae in all species are defined as those vertebrae which also carry a pair of ribs, and lie caudal to the cervical vertebrae. In humans, cervical vertebrae are the smallest of the true vertebrae, and can be readily distinguished from those of the thoracic or lumbar regions by the presence of a foramen (hole) in each transverse process, through which passes the vertebral artery." xsd:string

comment: one of the two types of osseous tissue that form bones. Compared to compact bone, which is the other type of osseous tissue, it has a higher surface area but is less dense, softer, weaker, and less stiff. It typically occurs at the ends of long bones, proximal to joints and within the interior of vertebrae. Cancellous bone is highly vascular and frequently contains red bone marrow where hematopoiesis, which is the production of blood cells, occurs. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cancellous bone is the trabecula.

def: "The neck of the rib is the flattened portion which extends lateralward from the head; it is about 2.5 cm. long, and is placed in front of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrC& with which the head articulates. Its anterior surface is flat and smooth, its posterior rough for the attachment of the ligament of the neck, and perforated by numerous foramina. Of its two borders the superior presents a rough crest (crista colli costE) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse ligament; its inferior border is rounded. On the posterior surface at the junction of the neck and body, and nearer the lower than the upper border, is an eminencebthe tubercle; it consists of an articular and a non-articular portion. The articular portion, the lower and more medial of the two, presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrC& to which the head is connected. The non-articular portion is a rough elevation, and affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. The tubercle is much more prominent in the upper than in the lower ribs."

def: "A synovial joint of the jaw that connects the mandible to the temporal bone." [Wikipedia:Temporomandibular_joint]
comment: There are two TMJs, one on either side, working in unison. The unique feature of the TMJs is the articular disc. The disc is composed of fibrocartilagenous tissue (like the firm and flexible elastic cartilage of the ear) which is positioned between the two bones that form the joint. The TMJs are one of the only synovial joints in the human body with an articular disc, another being the sternoclavicular joint. The disc divides each joint into two. The lower joint compartment formed by the mandible and the articular disc is involved in rotational movement -- this is the initial movement of the jaw when the mouth opens. The upper joint compartment formed by the articular disk and the temporal bone is involved in translational movement -- this is the secondary gliding motion of the jaw as it is opened widely. The part of the mandible which mates to the under-surface of the disc is the condyle and the part of the temporal bone which mates to the upper surface of the disk is the glenoid (or mandibular) fossa[WP].

def: "Vertebra prominens is the proper name for the seventh cervical vertebra. The most distinctive characteristic of this vertebra is the existence of a long and prominent spinous process which is palpable from the skin surface, hence the name. This spinous process is thick, nearly horizontal in direction, not bifurcated, but terminating in a tubercle to which the lower end of the ligamentum nuchae is attached. The seventh cervical vertebra (C7) has the most prominent spinous process only in about 70% of people; in the remainder, either C6 or T1 (the first thoracic vertebra) will be the most prominent. The transverse processes are of considerable size, their posterior roots are large and prominent, while the anterior are small and faintly marked; the upper surface of each has usually a shallow sulcus for the eighth spinal nerve, and its extremity seldom presents more than a trace of bifurcation. The foramen transversarium may be as large as that in the other cervical vertebrae, but is generally smaller on one or both sides; occasionally it is double, sometimes it is absent. On the left side it occasionally gives passage to the vertebral artery; more frequently the vertebral vein traverses it on both sides; but the usual arrangement is for both artery and vein to pass in front of the transverse process, and not through the foramen. Sometimes the anterior root of the transverse process attains a large size and exists as a separate bone, which is known as a cervical rib." [Wikipedia:Vertebra_prominens]

In such animals, it is referred to as the dentary bone, and forms the body of the outer surface of the jaw. It is bordered below by a number of splenial bones, while the angle of the jaw is formed by a lower angular bone and a suprangular bone just above it. The inner surface of the jaw is lined by a prearticular bone, while the articular bone forms the articulation with the skull proper. Finally a set of three narrow coronoid bones lie above the prearticular bone. As the name implies, the majority of the teeth are attached to the dentary, but there are commonly also teeth on the coronoid bones, and sometimes on the prearticular as well. This complex primitive pattern has, however, been simplified to various degrees in the great majority of vertebrates, as bones have either fused or vanished entirely. In teleosts, only the dentary, articular, and angular bones remain, while in living amphibians, the dentary is accompanied only by the prearticular, and, in salamanders, one of the coronoids. The lower jaw of reptiles has only a single coronoid and splenial, but retains all the other primitive bones except the prearticular." xsd:string

comment: Four classes of mineralized tissues are found in vertebrates: bone, cartilage, dentine, and enamel. We think of cartilage and bone as skeletal tissues and of enamel and dentine as dental tissues, but enamel and dentine arose evolutionarily together with bone as skeletal tissues in the dermal skeleton (exoskeleton) of early vertebrates. Scales and teeth of sharks are examples of dermal skeletal elements that are still composed of the three ancient components-enamel, dentine, and bone. Cartilage, on the other hand, provided the basis for the second vertebrate skeletal system, the endoskeleton (Smith and Hall, 1990; Hall, 1998a,b). some invertebrate skeletal tissues have surprisingly bone-like features. Examples include chondrocytes interconnected by cell processes in cephalopod cartilages (Cole and Hall, 2004a,b), and the calcium phosphate layer in the shells of brachiopods (Rodland et al., 2003). However, neither bone nor mineralized cartilage have been found in invertebrates. Editors notes: TODO - develops_from

It attaches to the mandible and it attaches to the skin of the head, neck, and thoracic region where it is found superficial to the clavicle. Burrows et al.

A more or less independent fasciculus, the occipitalis minor, may extend from the fascia over the trapezius to fascia over the insertion of the sternocleidomastoideus.

comment: In teleost fishes the opening is wider that in mammals. Due to the longer and deeper shape in mammals, this is usually called the optic canal; sometimes the term optic foramen may be used for the opening of the canal, but here we use this term to denote the entire space together with surrounding bone surface.

When the hand faces forward the olecranon faces towards the back (posteriorly). It is bent forward at the summit so as to present a prominent lip which is received into the olecranon fossa of the humerus in extension of the forearm. Its base is contracted where it joins the body and the narrowest part of the upper end of the ulna. Its posterior surface, directed backward, is triangular, smooth, subcutaneous, and covered by a bursa. Its superior surface is of quadrilateral form, marked behind by a rough impression for the insertion of the Triceps brachii; and in front, near the margin, by a slight transverse groove for the attachment of part of the posterior ligament of the elbow-joint. Its anterior surface is smooth, concave, and forms the upper part of the semilunar notch. Its borders present continuations of the groove on the margin of the superior surface; they serve for the attachment of ligaments, viz. , the back part of the ulnar collateral ligament medially, and the posterior ligament laterally.

It has properties of both the anterior canines and posterior molars, and so food can be transferred from the canines to the premolars and finally to the molars for grinding, instead of directly from the canines to the molars. The premolars in humans are the maxillary first premolar, maxillary second premolar, mandibular first premolar, and the mandibular second premolar. There is always one large buccal cusp, especially so in the mandibular first premolar. The lower second premolar almost always presents with two lingual cusps. Premolar teeth by definition are permanent teeth distal to the canines preceded by deciduous molars. In primitive mammals there are four premolars per quadrant.

def: "The extensor minimi digiti (extensor digiti quinti proprius) is a slender muscle of the forearm, placed on the ulnar side of the Extensor digitorum communis, with which it is generally connected. It arises from the common Extensor tendon by a thin tendinous slip, from the intermuscular septa between it and the adjacent muscles. Its tendon runs through a compartment of the dorsal carpal ligament behind the distal radio-ulnar joint, then divides into two as it crosses the manus, and finally joins the expansion of the Extensor digitorum communis tendon on the dorsum of the first phalanx of the little finger[WP]." [http://www.anatomyatlases.org/AnatomicVariants/MuscularSystem/Text/E/14Extensor.shtml, Wikipedia:Extensor_digiti_minimi_muscle]
comment: The tendon of insertion is sometimes divided and gives a slip to the fourth digit. An ulnar slip has been observed to end on the base of the fifth metacarpal, thus exactly reproducing the arrangement of the serially homologous slip known as peroneus tertius in the leg. The muscle may be absent in rare cases, but fusion with extensor digitorum is frequent, in which case the tendon comes from the common extensor.

def: "A pennate muscle (also called a penniform muscle) is a muscle with fascicles that attach obliquely (in a slanting position) to its tendon. These types of muscles generally allow better stabilization and force production but less flexibility. Individual muscle fibers are formed into bundles of fasciculi and these bundles of fasciculi are formed into bundles of fascicles which compose the entire muscle itself. In a pennate muscle, the fascicles will form an angle with its central tendon. If all the fascicles are on the same side of the tendon, the pennate muscle is called unipennate. Examples of this include certain muscles in the manus. If there are fascicles on both sides of the central tendon, the pennate muscle is called bipennate. The rectus femoris, a large muscle in the quadriceps, is typical. If the central tendon branches within a pennate muscle, the muscle is called multipennate, as seen in the deltoid muscle in the shoulder." [Wikipedia:Pennate_muscle]

Pearls and the inside layer of pearl oyster and freshwater pearl mussel shells are made of nacre. Many other families of mollusk also have a nacreous inner shell layer, including marine gastropods such as the Haliotidae, the Trochidae and the Turbinidae. Nacre is composed of hexagonal platelets of aragonite (a form of calcium carbonate) 10-20 µm wide and 0.5 µm thick arranged in a continuous parallel lamina. These layers are separated by sheets of organic matrix composed of elastic biopolymers (such as chitin, lustrin and silk-like proteins)[WP]." [Wikipedia:Nacre]

The aryepiglottic muscle together with the transverse arytenoid and the thyroarytenoid work as a sphincter and close the larynx as we swallow or cough. Its innervation is by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (from vagus) just like all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx except the cricothyroid muscle." [Wikipedia:Oblique_arytenoid_muscle]

property_value: UBPROP:0000008 "The structure of the carpus varies widely between different groups of tetrapods, even among those that retain the full set of five digits. In primitive fossil amphibians, such as Eryops, the carpus consists of three rows of bones; a proximal row of three carpals, a second row of four bones, and a distal row of five bones. The proximal carpals are referred to as the radiale, intermediale, and ulnare, after their proximal articulations, and are homologous with the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetal bones respectively. The remaining bones are simply numbered, as the first to fourth centralia (singular: centrale), and the first to fifth distal carpals. Primitively, each of the distal bones appears to have articulated with a single metacarpal. However, the vast majority of later vertebrates, including modern amphibians, have undergone varying degrees of loss and fusion of these primitive bones, resulting in a smaller number of carpals. Almost all mammals and reptiles, for example, have lost the fifth distal carpal, and have only a single centrale - and even this is missing in humans. The pisiform bone is somewhat unusual, in that it first appears in primitive reptiles, and is never found in amphibians. Because many tetrapods have less than five digits on the forelimb, even greater degrees of fusion are common, and a huge array of different possible combinations are found. The wing of a modern bird, for example, has only two remaining carpals; the radiale (the scaphoid of mammals) and a bone formed from the fusion of four of the distal carpals. In some macropods, the scaphoid and lunar bones are fused into the scaphollunar bone" xsd:string

A deposit of calcareous material now takes place in this matrix, between the rows of cells, so that they become separated from each other by longitudinal columns of calcified matrix, presenting a granular and opaque appearance. Here and there the matrix between two cells of the same row also becomes calcified, and transverse bars of calcified substance stretch across from one calcareous column to another.

The vertebrate is basically an endoskeleton made up of two types of tissues (bone and cartilage). During early embryonic development the endoskeleton is composed of notochord and cartilage. The notochord in most vertebrates is replaced by vertebral column and cartilage is replaced by bone in most adults. In three phyla and one subclass of animals, endoskeletons of various complexity are found: Chordata, Echinodermata, Porifera, and Coleoidea. An endoskeleton may function purely for support (as in the case of sponges), but often serves as an attachment site for muscle and a mechanism for transmitting muscular forces. A true endoskeleton is derived from mesodermal tissue. Such a skeleton is present in echinoderms and chordates. The poriferan 'skeleton' consists of microscopic calcareous or siliceous spicules or a spongin network. The Coleoidae do not have a true endoskeleton in the evolutionary sense; here, a mollusk exoskeleton evolved into several sorts of internal structure, the 'cuttlebone' of cuttlefish being the best-known version. Yet they do have cartilaginous tissue in their body, even if it is not mineralized, especially in the head, where it forms a primitive cranium. The endoskeleton gives shape,support and protection to the body and provides a mean of locomotion.[Wikipedia:Endoskeleton]t" xsd:string {source="Wikipedia:Endoskeleton"}

For the following discussion, it may be best to refer to the images of tetrapod palates at, for example Ornithosuchus, Therapsida, or Palatines. In many tetrapods, it is the largest palatal bone and serves as the main structural support. Most typically, the pterygoids meet extensively on the mid-line of the palate and jointly send a process, the palatal ramus, anteriorly, which may cover the parasphenoid more or less completely. Sometimes this term is used to include the main body of the pterygoid as well. More variably, there are one or two anterolateral processes which go by various names, such as ectopterygoid ramus. In many amniotes, the pterygoid develops a strong transverse process or transverse flange which forms a bar running laterally across the palate. The pterygoid also articulates with (where present) the dorsoventral supports for the palate: the epipterygoid (dorsal) and the basipterygoid process of the braincase. Finally, the pterygoid sends a long, robust quadrate ramus with complex curvature down (posteroventrally) to grasp the quadrate and support the jaw articulation. Basally, in fishes, the terminology tends to be a little different. Refer to the image of the Frasnian actinistian Diplocercides. The pterygoid bone of tetrapods is, roughly speaking, derived from the middle, entopterygoid (see also entry at entopterygoid for alternative definitions) portion of the palatoquadrate complex. The entopterygoid is not actually a part of the palatoquadrate. It is a dermal bone which has replaced the middle section of the primitively continuous endochondral bone of the palatoquadrate, the original upper jaw. In tetrapods, the pterygoid advances further, and also replaces the central part of the posterior, pterygoquadrate unit. This becomes the quadrate ramus. The upper part of this unit, the portion involved in the dorsal and basipterygoid articulations between jaw and braincase, is referred to as the metapterygoid. In tetrapods, most of this region is incorporated into the pterygoid as well, with the exception of the ascending process of the palatoquadrate, which becomes the epipterygoid.

The peripheral metacarpals (those of the thumb and little finger) form the sides of the cup of the palmar gutter and as they are brought together they deepen this concavity. The index metacarpal is the most firmly fixed, while the thumb metacarpal articulates with the trapezium and acts independently from the others. The middle metacarpals are tightly united to the carpus by intrinsic interlocking bone elements at their bases.

The salpingopharyngeus is known to raise the pharynx and larynx during deglutition (swallowing) and laterally draws the pharyngeal walls up. In addition, it opens the pharyngeal orifice of the pharyngotympanic tube during swallowing. This allows for the equalization of pressure between the auditory canal and the pharynx.

def: "The humeroulnar joint, is part of the elbow-joint or the Olecron Joint, between the ulna and humerus bones is the simple hinge-joint, which allows for movements of flexion, extension and circumduction. The Humero-Ulnar Joint is the junction of trochlear notch of the ulna and the trochlea of the humerus. Owing to the obliquity of the trochlea of the humerus, this movement does not take place in the antero-posterior plane of the body of the humerus. When the forearm is extended and supinated, the axis of the arm and forearm are not in the same line; the arm forms an obtuse angle with the forearm. During flexion, however, the forearm and the hand tend to approach the middle line of the body, and thus enable the hand to be easily carried to the face. The accurate adaptation of the trochlea of the humerus, with its prominences and depressions, to the semilunar notch of the ulna, prevents any lateral movement. Flexion is produced by the action of the Biceps brachii and Brachialis, assisted by the Brachioradialis, with a tiny contribution from the muscles arising from the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Extension is produced by the Triceps brachii and AnconC&us, with a tiny contribution from the muscles arising from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, such as the Extensor digitorum communis."

According to Edgeworth (1935) and Winterbottom (1974), the protractor hyoideus is composed of a fusion of the intermandibularis posterior and the interhyoideus muscles which resulted in the protractor hyoideus which spans the hyoid and mandible. The intermandibularis spans the mandible while the closely apposed interhyoideus spans the hyoid in other fishes. Furthermore, they concluded that any muscle that is homologous to the geniohyoideus (coracomandibularis coupling) in other lower vertebrates has been lost in teleosts, as well as gars. However, the protractor hyoideus muscle is functionally analogous to the coracomandibularis coupling of other vertebrates and so we use it in our discussion to show the phylogenetically broad roles of these couplings in jaw mechanics.'" xsd:string {source="DOI:10.1006/bijl.2000.0436"}

It provides connection and communication in the form of aponeuroses, ligaments, tendons, retinacula, joint capsules, and septa. The deep fasciae envelop all bone; cartilage, and blood vessels and become specialized in muscles and nerves. The high density of collagen fibers is what gives the deep fascia its strength and integrity. The amount of elastin fiber determines how much extensibility and resilience it will have."

It is distinctly narrow and is united with the cleidocervicalis and cleidobrachialis by the clavicular tendon. Together with the other two components of the brachiocephalicus muscle, its primary function is to advance the free limb, however, it can also act as an shoulder extensor. Acting bilaterally, it fixes and depresses the neck, while by its unilateral action, it allows the head and neck to be drawn to the side. Its blood supply is the inferior cervical, carotid and vertebral arteries and its nerve supply is the spinal accessory, cervical and axillary nerves." [MURDOCH:379]

def: "The brachiocephalicus is a long and flat, complex of muscles that extends from the lower half of the humeral shaft to the head and neck. The muscle divides into two parts at the clavicular intersection. This is also the point of origin for all the muscles that make up the brachiocephalicus. This point is situated just cranial to the shoulder. The two main sections are the cleidobrachialis which is distal to the clavicular intersection and the cleidocephalicus which extends proximally to the clavivular intersection. The cleidocephalicus can also be divided into the pars cervicalis, which inserts on the broad aponeurosis, over the fibrous raphe of the cranial half of the neck. The other part, the pars mastoideus inserts on the mastoid process of the temporal bone via a strong tendon. The cleidobrachialis extends distally from the clavicular intersection and inserts on the cranial edge of the distal half of the humerus. The tendon that inserts the cleidobrachialis lies between the brachialis muscle and the biceps brachii. As a result of the brachiocephalicus spanning a large region it has the ability to provide a number of actions. These include extending the shoulder joint, protracts the limb, provides lateral movement of the head and allows the neck to be depressed." [http://ccg.murdoch.edu.au/museum/]
comment: The brachiocephalicus is more complex than other muscles of the forelimb. It consists of 2 elements that unite at the clavicle in dogs. In dogs the caudal part, known as the cleidobrachialis, runs from the clavicle to the humerus and is closely associated with the deltoid. The cranial portion runs from the clavicle to various attachments via a broad aponeurosis on the upper part of the head and neck. It is called the cleidomastoideus in the dog because it inserts on the mastoid process of the temporal bone. It may have a different name, like cleido-occipitalis, in other mammals. The name brachiocephalicus signifies that this complex of muscles runs from the upper arm to the head and does not specify the details of muscle attachments because these vary so much from species to species. The brachiocephalicus advances the limb and may also extend the shoulder joint, but this depends on the cranial attachment being fixed and the limb being free to move. However, when the forelimb is firmly on the ground and the head is free to move, it forces the head and neck either ventrally or to one side depending on whether or not both muscles act in tandem

The surangular articulates with and supports the articular, which forms the jaw joint with the quadrate in most vertebrates, and is in turn supported by the angular. More distally, the surangular bridges the mandibular fenestra, if one is present. It may also bear a raised dorsal coronoid process, an important attachment site for the mandibular adductors. At its distal (or rostral) end, the surangular meets the dentary, the main tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw in most vertebrates."

This articulation is present in all but the eleventh and twelfth ribs. Ribs 1 to 10 have two joints in close proximity posteriorly; the costovertebral joints and the costotranseverse joints. This arrangement restrains the motion of the ribs allowing them to work in a parallel fashion during breathing. If a typical rib had only one joint posteriorly the resultant swivel action would allow a rib to be non-parallel with respect to the neighboring ribs making for a very inefficient respiratory mechanism. The ventral rami innervate the costotransverse joints. Therefore, therapeutic medial branch blocks are ineffectual.

property_value: UBPROP:0000001 "Epipubic bones are a pair of bones projecting forward from the pelvic bones of modern marsupials and of some fossil mammals: multituberculates, monotremes, and even basal eutherians (the ancestors of placental mammals). In modern marsupials the epipubic bones are often called 'marsupial bones' because they support the mother's pouch ('marsupium' is Latin for 'pouch'), but their presence on other groups of mammals indicates that this was not their original function, which some researchers think was to assist locomotion by supporting some of the muscles that flex the thigh. The epipubic bones were first described in 1698 but their functions have remained unresolved. It has been suggested that they form part of a kinetic linkage stretching from the femur on one side to the ribs on the opposite side. This linkage is formed by a series of muscles: each epipubic bone is connected to the femur by the pectineus muscle, and to the ribs and vertebrae by the pyramidalis, rectus abdominis, and external and internal obliques. According to this hypothesis, the epipubic bones act as levers to stiffen the trunk during locomotion[Wikipedia:Epipubic_bone]." xsd:string {source="Wikipedia:Epipubic_bone"}

In front of this margin the surface gives origin to the Quadratus femoris, and anterior to this to some of the fibers of origin of the Obturator externus; the lower part of the surface gives origin to part of the Adductor magnus. The internal surface forms part of the bony wall of the lesser pelvis. In front it is limited by the posterior margin of the obturator foramen. Below, it is bounded by a sharp ridge which gives attachment to a falciform prolongation of the sacrotuberous ligament, and, more anteriorly, gives origin to the Transversus perinC&i and Ischiocavernosus.

property_value: UBPROP:0000008 "Humans have 24 ribs (12 pairs). The first seven sets of ribs, known as 'true ribs', are directly attached to the sternum through the costal cartilage. The following five sets are known as 'false ribs', three of these sharing a common cartilaginous connection to the sternum, while the last two (eleventh and twelfth ribs) are termed floating ribs (costae fluitantes) or vertebral ribs. They are attached to the vertebrae only, and not to the sternum or cartilage coming off of the sternum. Some people are missing one of the two pairs of floating ribs, while others have a third pair. Rib removal is the surgical excision of ribs for therapeutic or cosmetic reasons. In fish, there are often two sets of ribs attached to the vertebral column. One set, the dorsal ribs, are found in the dividing septum between the upper and lower parts of the main muscle segments, projecting roughly sideways from the vertebral column. The second set, of ventral ribs arise from the vertebral column just below the dorsal ribs, and enclose the lower body, often joining at the tips. Not all species possess both types of rib, with the dorsal ribs being most commonly absent. Sharks, for example, have no dorsal ribs, and only very short ventral ribs, while lampreys have no ribs at all. In some teleosts, there may be additional rib-like bones within the muscle mass. Tetrapods, however, only ever have a single set of ribs which are probably homologous with the dorsal ribs of fishes. In the early tetrapods, every vertebra bore a pair of ribs, although those on the thoracic vertebrae are typically the longest. The sacral ribs were stout and short, since they formed part of the pelvis, connecting the backbone to the hip bones.[1] In most subsequent forms, many of these early ribs have been lost, and in living amphibians and reptiles, there is great variation in rib structure and number. For example, turtles have only eight pairs of ribs, which are developed into a bony or cartilagenous carapace and plastron, while snakes have numerous ribs running along the full length of their trunk. Frogs typically have no ribs, aside from a sacral pair, which form part of the pelvis.[1]. In birds, ribs are present as distinct bones only on the thoracic region, although small fused ribs are present on the cervical vertebrae. The thoracic ribs of birds possess a wide projection to the rear; this uncinate process is an attachment for the shoulder muscles.[1]. Mammals usually also only have distinct ribs on the thoracic vertebra, although fixed cervical ribs are also present in monotremes. In marsupials and placental mammals, the cervical and lumbar ribs are found only as tiny remnants fused to the vertebrae, where they are referred to as transverse processes. In general, the structure and number of the true ribs in humans is similar to that in other mammals. Unlike reptiles, caudal ribs are never found in mammals." xsd:string

The superficial temporal vessels and the auriculotemporal nerve cross it from below upward. Above, it is a single layer, attached to the entire extent of the superior temporal line; but below, where it is fixed to the zygomatic arch, it consists of two layers, one of which is inserted into the lateral, and the other into the medial border of the arch. A small quantity of fat, the orbital branch of the superficial temporal artery, and a filament from the zygomatic branch of the maxillary nerve, are contained between these two layers. It affords attachment by its deep surface to the superficial fibers of the Temporalis." [Wikipedia:Temporal_fascia]

comment: Actinotrichia are required for lepidotrichium development. They are occasionally retained in adult fishes. Further taxon comments from Witten & Huysseune (2007): 'Actinotrichia are found in the embryonic fin fold, along the outer edge of the fin in Actinopterygii, and in the adipose fin in teleosts (Starck 1979; Géraudie and Meunier 1982; Becerra et al. 1983). Only in polypterids has their presence been reported in the joints between adjacent lepidotrichial elements (Géraudie 1988). In the sarcopterygian lineage, actinotrichia are present in coelacanths (Géraudie and Meunier 1980) and in young dipnoans (Arratia et al. 2001).'

A suborbital (also named postorbital by some authors) is not present in extant teleosts with the exception of Arapaima where it is occasionally present.

comment: Although the branchiostegals are articulated or attached to the hyoid arch, they belong to the opercular series. Branchiostegal rays are of variable shape and number and their homology is problematic. Usually they are numbered from anterior to posterior elements, instead from posterior to anteriorly considering that the last element of the series is consistently associated to the subopercle.

comment: The cartilaginous autopalatine forms from the anterior palatoquadrate arch. Possession of a dorsomedial process, which abuts the ethmoid, is a unique feature shared by Cypriniformes (Fink and Fink, 1981). The palatine has two components, the autopalatine (derived from pars autopalatine) and the dermal component having teeth, the dermopalatine Arratia & Schultze 1990. The element in cypriniforms is only the cartilage part, so that it is more correct to name it autopalatine and not as palatine in general that it implies a fusion of elements (as in perciforms).

An epural commonly supports one or more dorsal procurrent rays. An epural is an unpaired median perichondrally ossified bone." [TAO:Arratia and Schultze_1992]
comment: The origin of the epurals is unclear, three hypotheses have been proposed: 1) The epurals are modified radials or dorsal radials; 2) the epurals are detached neural spines and may support fin rays; and 3) the epurals are a serial homologue of the supraneuralia. At least in teleosts the epural is a detached neural spine. For details see Schultze and Arratia (1989) and Arratia and Schultze (1992).

comment: The term preural vertebra was created by Nybelin (1963) for those vertebrae supporting caudal procurrent rays. For additional information see Arratia and Schultze (1992). Their neural and hemal arches may or may not be fused to their corresponding autocentrum. Fusion or separation of certain neural and/or haemal arches of preural centra is characteristic or certain teleosts subgroup. The boundary between preural and ural region is determined by the bifurcation of the four or five blood vessels running inside the hemal arches of the preural vertebrae (primary caudal artery, two secondary arterial trunks, primary caudal vein, and secondary subvertebral vein) (for details see Schultze & Arratia, 1989). The bifurcation of the caudal artery and vein was proposed as a landmark to homologize preural centrum 1 throughout actinopterygians (Nybelin, 1963).

A caudal principal ray is an unpaired median bone." [TAO:GA_TG, TAO:wd]
comment: Counts of caudal principal rays are taken as the number of branched rays plus two adjacent unbranched rays and counts are typically reported as, for example: 1,8,7,1 (1 unbranched and 8 branched upper rays, 7 branched and 1 unbranched lower rays). A caudal principal caudal ray may be associated with one or more hypurals or with hemal spines of preural centra 1 and 2 (Schultze and Arratia, 1989; Arratia, 2008). In basal teleosts the number of caudal principal rays is about 20. A decreasing of the number of the branched-and segmented rays is observed in more advanced teleosts (see Schultze and Arratia, 1989; Arratia, 1991, 2008).

The presence of four pectoral proximal radials is interpreted as a synapomorphy of teleosts (Patterson 1977, Arratia 1999).

comment: The infraorbital series may include the antorbital, a variable number of infraorbitals, and dermosphenotic (or posteriormost dorsal infraorbital). The infraorbital series may be formed by seven (primitively) or less bones in teleosts. Consequently, the so called dermosphenotic may correspond to the seventh, sixth or fifth bone, etc., depending on the taxon.

Caudal principal rays are counted from the dorsalmost one ventrally. Caudal principal rays are unpaired median bones." [TAO:GA_TG]
comment: In basal teleosts the number of caudal principal rays is about 20. A decreasing of the number of the branched-and segmented rays is observed in more advanced teleosts (see Schultze and Arratia, 1989; Arratia, 1991, 2008). The presence of marginal principal caudal rays as long or longer than the branched-and-segmented principal rays is a synapomorphy of teleosts (Arratia, 2008, 2009).

comment: Two to four flat or slightly rod-like proximal pectoral radial elements, bilaterally, can be found in teleosts. Pectoral proximal radial elements are commonly hour-glass or rectangular shaped. The presence of four pectoral proximal radial elements is interpreted as a synapomorphy of teleosts (Patterson 1977, Arratia 1999).

comment: Two to four flat or slightly rod-like proximal pectoral radials, bilaterally, can be found in teleosts. Pectoral proximal radials are commonly hour-glass or rectangular shaped. The presence of four pectoral proximal radials is interpreted as a synapomorphy of teleosts (Patterson 1977, Arratia 1999).

def: "Cartilage element associated with the pelvic fin in aulopiform fishes." [PHENOSCAPE]
comment: Paralepidids (except Anotopterus), Alepisaurus, and evermannellids have a well-developed cartilage that extends dorsally into the body musculature from the region where the lateral pelvic-fin rays articulate with the girdle. In some young specimens, this cartilage is attached by a small rod of cartilage to the cartilage capping the central process, suggesting that it originates as part of the lateral cartilage. A similar cartilage is present in myctophids (Fig. 4A) but lacking in other aulopiforms and outgroups. [From Baldwin CC & Johnson GD (1996) Interrelationships of Aulopiformes. Interrelationships of Fishes, eds Stiassny MLJ, Parenti LR, & Johnson GD (Academic Press, San Diego, CA), pp 355-404.]
